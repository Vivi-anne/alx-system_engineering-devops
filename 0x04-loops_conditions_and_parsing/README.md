	- Write a Bash script that displays `Best School` 10 times using a `for` loop.

-  **2. While Best School loop**
	- Write a Bash script that displays `Best School` 10 times using the `while` loop.

- **3. Until Best School loop**
	- Write a Bash script that displays `Best School` 10 times using the `until` loop.

- **4. If 9, say Hi!**
	- Write a Bash script that displays `Best School` 10 times, but for the 9th iteration, displays Best School and then Hi on a new line.
